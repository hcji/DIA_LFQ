## DIA_LFQ

This repository aims to collect scripts for a standard pipeline for label-free quantification with data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry. This repository is still in development.

### 1. Building assay libraries with DDA

This step follows the protocols given by the [reference](https://www.nature.com/articles/nprot.2015.015). The scripts are included in the *DDA2ProtLib* folder

#### Depends:

(1) [**ProteoWizard**](http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net/)

(2) [**X!Tandem**](https://www.thegpm.org/tandem/)

(3) [**Comet**](http://comet-ms.sourceforge.net/)



### 2. Data process with OpenSWATH workflow



### 3. Post-process for label-free quantification
